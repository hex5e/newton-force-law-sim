# Newton Force Law Simulation

This project demonstrates a spring-mass system simulation built using SOLID principles. Forces, integrators, collision logic and visualization are all modular.

## Installation

Use pip to install the small set of dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the simulation

Execute the `simulation.py` module to run the default example:

```bash
python simulation.py
```

An animated matplotlib window will display the motion of masses arranged in a hexagon and a plot of the total system energy.

## Repository contents

- `simulation.py` &mdash; full implementation and example `main()` function.
- `requirements.txt` &mdash; Python dependencies.
